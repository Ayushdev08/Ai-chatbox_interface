# **AiworkSquad Chat Application**

A simple chat application built with React, designed to simulate a chatbot that responds based on selected departments (Marketing, Sales). Users can log in, interact with the bot, and view chat history.

## **Features**

- **Login Page**: Simple form for user authentication (with basic validation and local storage support).
- **Chat Interface**: Interactive chat area where users can send messages and receive bot responses.
- **Department Selection**: Choose between Marketing and Sales for department-specific bot responses.
- **Chat History**: View past conversations and load them with a click.
- **Responsive UI**: The app layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Logout Functionality**: Securely log out and reset the user state.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AiworkSquad-Chat.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

## **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: React
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)
- **Icons**: `lucide-react` (for icons in the chat interface)

## **Features and Functionality**

- **LoginPage Component**: Handles user login, with a "remember me" feature using local storage to persist credentials.
- **ChatInterface Component**: Allows users to select a department (Marketing, Sales) and interact with the chatbot. Messages are displayed and auto-scrolled to the bottom.
- **Message Handling**: The chat simulates responses based on the department and user input.
- **Chat History**: Allows users to save and load past conversations.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Implement real-time chat functionality with a backend (e.g., Node.js, Express).
- Integrate a dynamic chatbot using NLP (e.g., GPT-3 or DialogFlow).
- Improve authentication by using secure token storage (JWT).
- Implement responsive design improvements for all screen sizes.
